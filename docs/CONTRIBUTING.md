Contributing
------------

I'd absolutely love it if you made first_nes better! Let's do it according to these guidelines:

1. Submit an issue to the [issues page](https://github.com/gregkrsak/first_nes/issues), describing your bug (or suggestion) in detail.

2. If you see an existing issue that sounds interesting, feel free to jump in and work on it.

3. [Fork](https://help.github.com/articles/fork-a-repo/) the first_nes repository.

4. In your fork, [reference the issue](https://help.github.com/articles/autolinked-references-and-urls/) you're working on with targeted, clear commits. Please keep commits relevant to a single issue, if possible.

5. Finally, reference any issues when you submit a [pull request](https://help.github.com/articles/about-pull-requests/) to the ```staging``` branch. Feel free to submit a pull request that fixes more than one issue.
